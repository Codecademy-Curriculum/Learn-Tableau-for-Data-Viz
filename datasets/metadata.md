Here's a rundown of all the changes we made to datasets in this folder *before* we uploaded them.  Find their original sources in the README.md file for this repository. Any other changes to this data will be made by **YOU!** in Tableau.

#### NYC Tree Census (2015)
After downloading this dataset, we deleted the following columns to reduce file size from 236MB to <100MB. 

`[ 'created_at', 'block_id', 'the_geom', 'stump_diam', 'curb_loc', 'steward', 'guards', 'sidewalk', 'user_type', 'problems', 'root_stone', 'root_grate', 'root_other', 'trnk_wire', 'trnk_light', 'trnk_other', 'brnch_ligh', 'brnch_shoe', 'brnch_othe', 'zip_city', 'borocode', 'cb_num','cncldist', 'st_assem', 'st_senate', 'nta',  'boro_ct','x_sp', 'y_sp']`

#### Tree Species
We pulled this source from [a Wikipedia list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tree_species_in_New_York_City) and made no changes. The orginial dataset includes photos, and ours does not. 

#### NYC Income (2015)
We made a [custom query of all NYC zip codes](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Income%20and%20Poverty&g=0500000US36005%248600000,36047%248600000,36061%248600000,36081%248600000,36085%248600000&tid=ACSST5Y2015.S1901) using the United States Census Bureau website. Several changes were made to this data after downloading from the original source to make the file smaller and more manageable in Tableau. We deleted all columns except a geographic identifier, zip code, and 6 income-related fields: mean, median and total household income estimates, and margin of error for each income estimate. We also cleaned the data: removed the string `ZCTA5` from all zip code fields, removed stray characters like "+" and "!", and replaced Census Bureau abbreviations in the first row with more readable column names. 

#### Rotten Tomatoes
No changes were made to this data after downloading from the original source.

#### Significant Volcanoes
No changes were made to this data after downloading from the original source.

#### FAA Wildlife Strikes
After downloading from the original source, we modified the `Airport Code` field to remove the "K" (i.e. changing codes from "KLGA" to "LGA") -- this allows us to join this dataset to the Passenger Count dataset on the `IATA code` field. When aggregating by year in Tableau, we filter out 2015 data as it contains records from only the first half of that year. 

#### Passenger Counts (2014)
We pulled this list from a [Wikipedia source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_airports_by_passenger_traffic_(2010â€“2015)) and filtered on US airports. We cut several US airports that were on the list but did not have passenger counts, bringing the full list from 64 to 58 airports.
