# Learn-Tableau-for-Data-Viz
This is the Github repository for all the datasets in our Learn Tableau for Data Viz course. We recommend saving the Datasets folder where you can access it from the desktop version of Tableau Public. This way, you'll have all the datasets covered in every lesson and project -- ready to go!

⚡ **If you just want to get started ASAP...** 

Skip the rest of this and simply **download the Datasets folder** and get back to Codecademy and Tableau!

📔 **For more info on this repository, read on...**

The Datasets folder in this repo contains the following datasets. They are organized here by their place in the course, with links to orginal sources for your reference. A list of our changes to datasets can be found in the Datasets folder [**metadata.md**](https://github.com/Codecademy-Curriculum/Learn-Tableau-for-Data-Viz/blob/main/datasets/metadata.md) document.

🚨 DO NOT download these sources to use in your projects, as the data at these links are not all exactly the same as the data we'll use in the course. In some cases, we've cleaned data to make it usable in Tableau.

Duplicate datasets are shown here but appear only once in the Datasets folder.
